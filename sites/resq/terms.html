               <h5 class="terms-title">ABOUT OUR SERVICES</h5>
               <p class="term-subtext">The RESQ BUTTON App is a companion App for the Panic ResQ Button, Location ResQ Button and Tracker ResQ Button Hardware to communicate with our cloud services ResQ Cloud Engine. When You install the App and click the accept button the services of ResQ Cloud Engine are available on the App.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext">You must provide certain devices, software and data connections in order to use our product and services, which are otherwise not supplied by us. For as long as you use our product and services you consent to downloading and installing, both automatically and otherwise updates to the App on your device.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext">The Panic/Location/Tracker ResQ Button hardware has been designed for normal wear and tear. As a user it is your responsibility to not physically tamper and damage the device which otherwise may become inoperable. The hardware has a built-in battery which may or may not require recharge. If a product requires recharge or replacement of batteries we shall inform you in advance. The battery usage of each product is determined by how much time, the hardware was used as calculated by the ResQ Cloud Engine. There are chances that you might have drained the battery without connectivity to the ResQ Cloud Engine causing the product inoperable when required. All hardware devices do not have direct connectivity to the ResQ Cloud Engine, and may use one or more phones in the vicinity of the signal and use a co-operative app’s help to forward it to the ResQ Cloud Engine. You shall ensure that for effective usage of ResQ Hardware in conjunction with ResQ Cloud Services you shall have data connectivity on the device. Use of the hardware product requires the ResQ Hardware device to be always in the vicinity of the signal range of one or more devices with the App. You shall ensure that the ResQButton App device has its Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and location services switched on.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext">Based on the emergency or as requested by you or your emergency contacts or volunteers and emergency responders might call police directly from their phone. We can only inform police for the jurisdiction where they have SMS capable number and you have informed the details to us. We shall not be responsible or liable for you making repeatedly hoax calls to your local police department. Any civil and criminal proceedings initiated by police department or other legal entities for the false activations, shall be re-directed to you.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext"><strong>PANIC RESQ BUTTON HARDWARE</strong> has a built-in a battery which has a life-time of 24 months from manufacture or 300 activations whichever comes earlier to notify your emergency contacts. Replacing the battery or opening the Panic ResQ Button Hardware will void the warranty and service terms. Reporting Panic Situations the location accuracy is guaranteed based on the device(s) picked up the distress signal. Once the Panic ResQ Button Hardware is activated for distress signal, it does have a false activation mechanism which prevents re-activation within certain timeframe of about 5 – 10 minutes. Also once the Panic ResQ Button Hardware is activated it will do an auto shut-off after an hour to conserve battery</p>
               <p class="term-subtext"><strong>TRACKER RESQ BUTTON HARDWARE</strong> is used to track an object, asset or people whereabouts, accuracy of the location is guaranteed as long as the signal from the button is picked by your designated devices. If you are planning to use this to track your employees either their work hours and whereabouts it is your responsibility to check the local laws before using for their intended purposes. If you are planning to track any individual you take responsibility on the applicable privacy laws.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext"><strong>LOCATION RESQ BUTTON HARDWARE</strong> is used to mark micro geo-locations with certain characteristics to provide some information about the location and hence use of navigational and content information is not authenticated/verified by the “Company”. Any information provided by such Location ResQ Button Hardware is not the responsibility of the “Company”.</p>
               <p class="term-subtext">You shall be responsible for all carrier data plans and other fees and taxes associated with your use of our hardware, software products and services. We may charge you for our Services, including applicable taxes. In case you refuse and/or cancel orders we do not provide a refund for our services.

               <p class="term-subtext">To be a Volunteer in the <strong>ResQ Button App</strong> is a privilege not a right. When you opt for being a volunteer to help someone in an emergency, you indemnify the Company and do not hold us responsible for any injury, disability or death sustained by you as a result of “Company” asking to you to help someone, this includes any eventuality happens to you on the way to the help someone.

The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties.</li>
                  <li>Stage 2: Arbitration. In case that mediation does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members – one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at a place decided by the Company. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the Parties.</li>
